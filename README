= Getting started =

As for now, the script is run seperately from Spotify. Plans are to make the script launch Spotify and automatically stop running when you close Spotify.

These instructions apply to Ubuntu only (but may work on other Debian-based distros)

To get it running, you first need to download the files. You'll find them in the "Downloads" section above. Unzip them to your home folder.

Next, make sure you have the right dependencies. Open up a terminal (ALT + F2, then write "xterm") and write:

    sudo apt-get install python-indicate 

Navigate to the folder where you unpacked the zip-file. Then run the script by typing

    python spotify-notify.py 

= FAQ =

Q: I have started the script before Spotify, why doesn't it work?
A: As for now, please start the script after Spotify (will hopefully be fixed in next version).

Q: I want to use the script just for the media key support. How can I do this?
A: Edit the script file and set ENABLE_NOTIFY to 0.

Q: Do I need Ubuntu to use this script? Will others distros work?
A: As the script uses the Ubuntu sound inidicator Ubuntu is required. Indicator dependencies should be easy to remove, however, if you wish to do so.
