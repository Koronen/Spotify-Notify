== Spotify-Notify ==

Spotify-Notify is a daemon program used for displaying the currently playing song
in Spotify on a Linux system, using the notify-osd notifier (found in e.g. Ubuntu).
It also includes support for media keys.
It is designed for and built on an Ubuntu system,
but should work on any system supporting Python, DBus and notify-osd.
Dependencies are notify-osd and python-indicate.

The script uses last.fm in order to fetch album cover and data.
